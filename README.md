Parameter inference and fast generation for three classes of neutral species assemblage models.

Te neutr R package contains a number of functions that perform the following tasks.
Estimation of the model parameter for three neutral models: the Ewens model, the multideme model and the Pitman models. 
Parameter inference is based on the maximization of the likelihood functions. 
The generation of typical abundance distributions of the Ewens and Pitman models given model parameter(s). 

The above tasks can be performed with very large sample sizes, on the order of up to 10^12 individuals.
